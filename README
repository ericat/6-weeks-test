This is Makers' Academy 6 weeks test.

Feedback:
- Well done for simplicity. Your code is concise, which is a good thing.
- It'd make sense to put your classes into lib/ but it's not a very big deal
- Well done for having the Command class
- However, you'd fail to get an interview at Forward because of a simple mistake in the flood fill
  unless you were applying for a junior position (because the rest is quite good)
